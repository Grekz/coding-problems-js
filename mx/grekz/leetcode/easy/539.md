## 539. Minimum Time Difference

### Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-difference/

### Problem

Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time-points in the list.

#### Example 1:

Input: timePoints = ["23:59","00:00"]\
Output: 1

#### Example 2:

Input: timePoints = ["00:00","23:59","00:00"]\
Output: 0

#### Constraints:

2 <= timePoints.length <= 2 \* 104\
timePoints[i] is in the format "HH:MM".

### Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} timePoints
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMinDifference = function (timePoints) {
  timePoints.sort()
  let min = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
  const points = timePoints.map((it) => it.split(":"))
  const [a, b] = timePoints[0].split(":")
  points.push([`${parseInt(a) + 24}`, b])
  for (let i = 1; i < points.length; ++i) {
    const [pHrs, pMin] = points[i - 1]
    const [cHrs, cMin] = points[i]
    const diff = (cHrs - pHrs) * 60 + (cMin - pMin)
    min = Math.min(diff, min)
  }
  return min
}
```
