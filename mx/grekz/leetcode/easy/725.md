## 725. Split Linked List in Parts

### Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts/description/

### Problem

Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer k, split the linked list into k consecutive linked list parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal to parts occurring later.

Return an array of the k parts.

#### Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3], k = 5\
Output: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]

#### Explanation:

The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.\
The last element output[4] is null, but its string representation as a ListNode is [].

#### Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], k = 3\
Output: [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7],[8,9,10]]\

#### Explanation:

The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.

#### Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 1000].\
0 <= Node.val <= 1000\
1 <= k <= 50

### Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {ListNode[]}
 */
var splitListToParts = function (head, k) {
  // get current size of linked list to know how many items should be in each subset
  let cur = head
  let size = 0
  while (cur !== null) {
    cur = cur.next
    ++size
  }
  // get the items per subset
  let items = Math.floor(size / k)

  // get how many times will we need to add an extra
  let remains = size % k

  const result = new Array(k).fill(null)
  let idx = 0
  cur = head

  // stack to store the pieces of the list
  const stack = []

  while (size > 0) {
    // iterate for the piece of the list that holds "items"
    for (let i = 0; i < items; ++i) {
      stack.push(cur)
      cur = cur.next
      --size
    }
    // add one more in case we need to put an extra on this piece of list
    if (remains > 0) {
      stack.push(cur)
      cur = cur.next
      size--
      remains--
    }
    // remove the link from the last node in this piece of the list
    stack.at(-1).next = null

    // add the node to results
    result[idx++] = stack[0]

    // reset the stack
    stack.length = 0
  }
  return result
}
```
